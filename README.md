About the Project:
URL Phishing Detection is a machine learning–based application designed to identify whether a given URL is legitimate or phishing. The system analyzes different characteristics of the URL, extracts key features, and predicts the safety of the link. It helps users identify malicious URLs and improves online safety through quick and accurate predictions.

Features:
• Detects whether a URL is phishing or legitimate
• Extracts important URL-based features
• Provides accuracy of prediction
• Simple and easy-to-run implementation
• Supports user input for checking any custom URL

Technologies Used:
• Python
• Machine Learning (URL feature classification model)
• Feature Extraction Techniques
• Flask or Streamlit (if a web interface is included)

Working Model:
The system uses a pre-trained machine learning model that evaluates URL characteristics such as length, special symbols, use of IP address, and subdomains. These features help the model determine patterns associated with phishing URLs and return the prediction.

How to Run the Project:
• Clone the repository
• Navigate to the project directory
• Install the required dependencies
• Run the application

Future Improvements:
• More advanced machine learning or deep learning models
• Real-time URL scanning
• Integration of webpage content analysis
• Improved user interface
• Option to retrain using additional datasets

Contributing:
Contributions are welcome. You may submit suggestions, improvements, or bug fixes through issues or pull requests.
