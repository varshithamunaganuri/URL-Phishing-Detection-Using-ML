# URL-Phishing-Detection

## About the Project
URL Phishing Detection is a machine-learning–based application designed to classify URLs as legitimate or phishing by analyzing URL characteristics and extracting key features. The system helps users identify unsafe links quickly and enhances online security.

## Features
- Detects whether a URL is phishing or legitimate  
- Extracts important URL-based features  
- Provides prediction accuracy  
- Simple and easy-to-run implementation  
- Supports user input for checking custom URLs  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Machine Learning (URL Classification Model)  
- Feature Extraction Techniques  
- Flask or Streamlit for Web Interface  

## Working Model
The model evaluates features such as URL length, presence of suspicious characters, IP address usage, number of subdomains, and other phishing indicators. These features are processed by the trained model to classify the URL as safe or malicious.

## How to Run the Project
1. Download or clone the repository  
2. Navigate to the project folder in your IDE  
3. Install required libraries using the provided requirements file  
4. Run the application  

## Model
A pre-trained machine learning model built using URL-based features is included in the project to perform classification without requiring any dataset.

## Future Improvements
- Adding advanced ML or deep learning models  
- Real-time URL scanning support  
- Webpage content analysis in addition to URL features  
- Improved user interface  
- Option to retrain the model using external datasets
